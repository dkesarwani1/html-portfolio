<h1>The Best Movies According to Spike</h1>

<h2>My top 5 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Your Name</h3>
<p>This movie made me fall in love for movies and made me realize how beatiful 2D animation can be.
The story itself is so fascinating yet can sometimes be confusing. Even the OST provided by Radwimps is just beatiful.
</p>
<h3>Joker</h3>
<p>This movie helped me realize how fucked up society really is. Joker as a protagonist is very unusual due to him being as a villian.
    However, the movie helped me realize that he is much more of a good person than people would give the credit for due to the rich always benefiting
    from everything from the poor and them struggling even more.

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>This movie encapsulates everything Christopher Nolan has done in his career. Even though its just a regular Batman movie. It did much more than
    people realized. It changed how movies would become in the future and it was the last masterpiece DC movie ever made. It shows how fear can run through a city and how the Jokers mind works.
